# Dobuki Directory Generator

Note: This Github action was originally copied from a hello world, so it has a lot of junk.
That way, it's very simple to use and works fine for what it needs to do.

## What does it do

This just lists all files in your repo, and puts them into a "dir.json" file at the root.

## Usage

Just look at one example where it's used:
